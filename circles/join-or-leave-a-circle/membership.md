# Guest Participant

Any member of the co-operative has the right to request participation in any Circle Meeting \(as a guest\). The level of participation will depend on the Circle but in general:

1. The Circle guest participates in the introduction and closing rounds of the meeting.
2. Any questions that the guest has should either be in asked in advance, in a dedicated space at the meeting itself or afterwards to the Circle Leader or Delegate.
3. The Circle guest agrees to absent themselves during any discussions of a confidential nature, as defined by the Circle or Equal Care Co-op's policies and procedures \(for example, Vulnerable Adults Policy\).

 All Circle Meeting minutes and membership will be available to members of the co-operative.
