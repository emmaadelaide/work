# everyday decisions

The organizational governance structure of Equal Care Co-op uses interlinking Circles. 

A Circle is a group of people with a specific purpose \(called an aim\) who work together to accomplish that purpose.

This involves making operations and policy decisions by consent within their specific area of responsibility \(called a domain\).

 No circleâ€™s policies shall conflict with the law, these bylaws, the principles and methods of sociocratic governance as defined in these bylaws, or the policies of other circles.

You can find all of Equal Care Co-op's circles \(with their aims and domains\), members and minutes in our [Circles Wiki](https://circles.equalcare.coop/).
