# work roles

A Circle may delegate responsibilities, tasks and authority to anyone to be carried out autonomously within the limits set by the Circle \(examples: social media content creator, bookkeeper etc.\)

Work Roles are created and changed regularly and a full list can be found at https://www.circles.equalcare.coop.
