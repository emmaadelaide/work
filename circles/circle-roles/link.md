# link

Everyone contributing their labour to Equal Care Co-op \(regardless of whether they are a Member or not\) has a Link.

Every Supported and Advocate Member has a Link.

Everyone else can ask for a Link and you never know, one might come along!

You cannot be a Link for someone if you have trouble seeing their value and potential.

You cannot be a Link for someone for more than one year.

To be a Link for someone you will:

* [x] Be an informal mentor and cheerleader for that person
* [x] Meet regularly, no less than once every three months - you and your linked person decide this together
* [x] Remember their birthday! Mark special occasions and co-ordinate kindnesses. 
* [x] Remind others about any health or accessibility needs your linked person has and ensure equipment, venues, meetings, events etc are bearing these in mind.
* [x] Keep them up to date with news \(as appropriate\)
* [x] Introduce them to Equal Care Co-op and support them in the work they are doing, whether that's unpaid or paid
* [x] Be the problem-solver. Share the problem, solve it together. Enlist others' help.
* [x] For those volunteering their time, you will help them plan and carry out their role, including:
  * [x] a role description shaped to suit them – we support role-shaping and ‘role-carving’ \(matching and creating roles to fit the person\)
  * [x] the amount of time it is likely to take up
  * [x] where the volunteering will take place
  * [x] any formal training or additional support that needs arranging
  * [x] support for their future aspirations, which may include paid work with Equal Care Co-op or moving into employment elsewhere.

Being a Link can be a lot of work, or a little, depending on who you are linked to, their strengths, needs and experience.
