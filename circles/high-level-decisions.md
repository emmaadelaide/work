  These are the decisions which affect how the co-operative does its work over
  at least a six month timescale. This also covers any decisions mentioned in
  the Rules of incorporation.

# long-term decisions

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Members Circle" %}
### Who?

All members of the co-operative \(supported, workers, advocates, investors\).

### When do they meet?

Four times a year: one annual general meeting and three general meetings.

### What do they decide?

1. High-level strategy
2. Who joins the board
3. Distribution of surplus
4. Dismissal of members
5. Annual budget

NB: Decisions will be made using the [Consent process](consent.md) in the first instance with the Voting to follow.

### Any jargon I need to know?

The 'Members Circle' is the same as the 'General Meetings' section of the Rules which discusses [meetings of the members](../the-bylaws/members-meetings.md) \(parts 42 - 72\). Its processes are as set out in the Rules of incorporation. 

The Members Circle uses the same organising processes set out in the [everyday decisions](everyday-decisions.md) section, with some additional support for making decisions with large groups.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Purpose Circle" %}
### Who?

The Board of Directors, together with any members they co-opt and the Leader and Delegate of the Co-Circle.

### When do they meet?

Pretty regularly, at the least they meet quarterly. At the most, it's every fortnight.

### What do they decide?

1. Budgets, funding applications and future development of the co-operative \(up to 6 months or 1 year\). 
2. Contracts which bind the co-operative.
3. Appointing and dismissing employees.
4. Appointing members.
5. Assessing the work of the co-operative and changing things for the better if they see that Equal Care Co-op is drifting away from its mission.

### Any jargon I need to know?

The Purpose Circle is the same as the Board of Directors described in the Rules of incorporation and is bound by those Rules. All the Rules set out in sections 73 - 110 apply to the Purpose Circle.

The Purpose Circle uses the same organising processes set out in the [everyday decisions](everyday-decisions.md) section, except where decisions must be made which are solely the remit of the Directors \(as set out in the Rules of incorporation sections 96 - 102\). In these cases the voting processes apply.

The role of Chairperson is the same as the [Facilitator ](circle-roles/facilitator.md)role.

The role of Co-operative Secretary is the same as the [Logbook Keeper ](circle-roles/logbook-keeper.md)role.
