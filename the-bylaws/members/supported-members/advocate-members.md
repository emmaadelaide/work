**Advocate Members** 

"A person may be admitted into membership as an Advocate Member subject to them meeting specified eligibility criteria as determined by the Board from time to time and in accordance with the Societyâ€™s membership offer. A person may not be admitted as an Advocate Member if the person they are advocate for is a Supported Member or has the capacity to become a Supported Member."
