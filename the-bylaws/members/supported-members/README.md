# supported members

#### What the Rules say

"Any regular user supported by the services of the Co-operative may be admitted into membership. The Board may, by providing prior written consent, accept an application from a Supported Member to change their membership category to become a Worker Member. Such a Member shall cease to be a Supported member from the date the consent to change membership category is issued by the Board."

#### What the Bylaws say

Any person supported by Equal Care Co-op, whether through volunteer or paid support, may apply to become a member after one month of regular support.

If someone stops being supported by Equal Care Co-op, this automatically ends Supported Membership.

Regular support consists of at least two hours per week, excluding any trial period.
