# member benefits

We are a multi-stakeholder co-operative, with four categories of members. There are benefits that apply to all members and benefits that apply only to specific categories.

We hope that you will enjoy being an active part of a kind and supportive community where you will have opportunities for personal growth, a chance to learn new skills, make new connections and work with others for positive social change and in new and innovative ways.
