# decisions

Members are the ultimate decision-makers for eccoo. While we may delegate decision-making to e.g. directors, co-ordinators, circles and leaders of work areas, all mandate traces back to the members. Becoming a member means you have a voice in what we do and how we do it. You are able to vote at meetings and be involved in guiding the direction of the organisation.
