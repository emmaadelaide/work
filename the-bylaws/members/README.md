![how we make decisions as a co-operative](../../.gitbook/assets/eccoo-voting-structure.jpg)

We are a multi-stakeholder co-operative, which means we are collectively owned by several member groups: it is the people who give and receive care and support who share the control. 

We also have some representation from the people supporting our vision financially \(although they have limited voting rights\). 

The Members are the ultimate decision-makers, although lots of those decisions are delegated to help the co-operative run well.
