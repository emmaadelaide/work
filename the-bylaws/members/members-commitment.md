### what the Rules say

> "All Members agree to attend general meetings and take an active interest in the operation and development of the Co-operative and its business. Members have a duty to respect the confidential nature of the business decisions of the Co-operative."

### what the bylaws say

Upon becoming a Member of any category, you agree to honour the Members Commitment:

1. The bigger Equal Care Co-op vision matters to me

2. I will make efforts to learn about the co-operative principles and the work of Equal Care Co-op

3. As far as I am able, I will participate actively in shaping the co-operative and help safeguard its future

\(As well as coming to our annual and quarterly members' meetings, some examples of active participation may include introducing us to someone who can help, giving some volunteer time, advocating for change, sharing us on social media or simply talking about it to a friend\).
