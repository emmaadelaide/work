# our rules & bylaws

This site \(https://work.equalcare.coop\) is our bylaws. They don't exist anywhere else. Any printed documents or other electronic documents which aren't in this site may not represent the up-to-date agreed version of how we work together. 

Our bylaws and their connected policies and procedures \(located at our soon-to-be-public policies.equalcare.coop\) are reviewed once every year at the least but it's better to think of them as an on-going, dynamic picture of the decision-making processes and working practices we're experimenting with at the moment.

Each new publication version of this Gitbook document represents an update agreed as part of a Purpose Circle meeting and is based on feedback and input from members. Changes can be small or big.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can find all of Equal Care Co-op's working groups, \(known as [circles](../circles/)\), members and minutes in our [Loomio ](https://www.loomio.org/g/fg1dwI0m/equal-care-co-op)group.

If you aren't part of Equal Care Co-op, you can see a high-level description of how we are organised at [https://equalcare.coop/circles](https://equalcare.coop/circles) \(NB. link not yet live\)
